# startup
Repository for startup application

I had used github in the past for different classes but this is the first time that I feel like I actually
understood what was happening and how to use it properly. This is going to make things much easier in the future
when I am working on these projects and projects with people in the future. 

Elevator Pitch:
Creating group chats with your study group can be complicated when people join the group late or leave the group early.
My application will allow users to create different group chats with eachother and change those group chats easily. With
a few simple taps or clicks people can be added to group chats or removed. The application will also allow for photo and
file sharing within the different chats. 

Key Features:
Instant chat with groups or individuals
Photo sharing
File sharing
Create and edit group chats
