# startup
Repository for startup application

I had used github in the past for different classes but this is the first time that I feel like I actually
understood what was happening and how to use it properly. This is going to make things much easier in the future
when I am working on these projects and projects with people in the future. 

**Elevator Pitch:**
Creating group chats with your study group can be complicated when people join the group late or leave the group early.
My application will allow users to create different group chats with eachother and change those group chats easily. With
a few simple taps or clicks people can be added to group chats or removed. The application will also allow for photo and
file sharing within the different chats. 

**Key Features:**
Instant chat with groups or individuals
Photo sharing
File sharing
Create and edit group chats

**Learned from Simon HTML:**
Something that I learned from working on this project is how important it is to make sure you know the basic outline of what
the application is going to look like before going into actually coding it. Knowing the layout and basics of the content will
make things much easier. I also learned how to connect the different html files together so they will work together for one
application. I thought it would have been one large file but now I see that it is beneficial to have multiple files working
together for the final project.

**Learned from Simon CSS:**
Something that I learned from working on this project is how simple and useful the framework can be. It make things so much
simpler when it came to adding buttons and creating user interaction. Something else that I learned was how useful it is to
double check all spelling, I had a few major bugs in the program simply because I was missing a letter in a word. This is something that is pretty easy to fix, I just need to be more mindful of what I am typing when I am typing it. 

**Learned fom Simon JS:**
Something that I learned from this assignment is how important it is to double check spacing. I had a few issues that I had that
were due to whitespace and spacing issues. I also learned how to get the different files to interact with eachother by listing the 
JS files in the html files.
